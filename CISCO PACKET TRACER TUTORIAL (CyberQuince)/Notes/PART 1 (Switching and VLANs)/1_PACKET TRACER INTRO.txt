Place a router and a switch together joined with a copper straight through cable
Attach a computer to the switch with a straight through connecting to the Fast ethernet port on the switch and the PC
Connect to the Gigabit ethernet ports between the swtich and the router
Now for the laptop to the router connect them using a console cable connecting to the console port on both.

and go to DESKTOP and go to COMMAND PROMPT we'll ping the router by:
`ping 10.0.0.1`

SIMULATION MODE
===============
In simulation mode, we get a snapshot state so the time freezes
We then run our `ping 10.0.0.1` and see the step-by-step procedure
In the packet that it transmitted we can click on and view its details
We can control the playback of the simulation with video controls, and see the details and state at each step

To ping without going into the command prompt, we can use Add Simple PDU from the toolbar
Click on source, then click on dest
