$(config-if)#switchport mode dynamic auto
Default on a lot of Cisco switches but is changing to dynamic desirable on most new switches

$(config-if)#switchport mode dynamic desirable
Makes the interface actively attempt to convert the link to a trunk link

$(config-if)#switchport mode trunk
Puts the interface into permanent trunking mode and negotiates to convert the neighbouring link into a trunk link. The interface becomes a trunk link even if the neighbouring interface is in access mode

$(config-if)#switchport mode nonegotiate
Prevents the interface from generating DTP(Dynamic Trunk Protocol, the protocol that negotiates trunking modes) frames. Interface must be first set to either trunk or access


ADMIN MODE + ADMIN MODE = LINK MODE
access + dynamic auto = access
access + dynamic desirable = access
access + trunk = traffic in the native VLAN will cross the link successfully but other VLANs traffic will not 
dynamic auto + dynamic auto = access
dynamic auto + dynamic desirable = trunk
dynamic auto + trunk = trunk
