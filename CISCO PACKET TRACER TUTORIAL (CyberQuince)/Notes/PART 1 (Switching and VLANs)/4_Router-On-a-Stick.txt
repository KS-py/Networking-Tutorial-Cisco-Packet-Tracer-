If there is the need for VLANS to communicate a router is needed.
Router on a stick is a specific configuration whose task is to connect different VLANs
The "on-a-stick" term is because there are several networks connected to the router, achieved by creating several virtual interfaces on top of physical interfaces.
Each virtual interface is a gateway for its VLAN

IEEE 802.1q == protocol for marking packets with "VLAN tags".
Once again remember packets are tagged just before being sent via trunk links and are untagged when they use an access link.

VLAN tagging
==============
IEEE 802.1q 
ISL [Inter Switch Link] (Cisco proprietary)

ISL
===
Adds a 26 byte header and a 4 byte CRC suffix to an Ethernet frame sent over a trunk link

EXERCISE
========
Recreate the diagram and configure the ff:
1. Hostname according to the diagram and add a banner on R1 with your name
2. Access interfaces and VLANs - 8 INTERFACES per VLAN
3. Trunk interfaces
4. Make sure to create all VLANs on all switches.
5. Configure R1 as a "Router-on-a-stick", with a DHCP server for both VLANs
6. IP addresses on PCs using DHCP


SOLUTIONS
==========
1. enter switches CLI: 
`enable`
`conf t`
`host S1`

enter Router CLI:
Choose NO to the initial configuration prompt
`enable`
`conf t`
`host R1`
`banner motd #KOJO#`


2. Enter config mode on switch 1 and do both, for the other switches just do their respective ones
`interface range FastEthernet 0/1-8`
`switchport mode access`
`switchport access vlan 200`

`interface range FastEthernet 0/9-16`
`switchport mode access`
`switchport access vlan 100`

3. We'll configure all the trunk interfaces and also configure the interface between the router and the rest of the network as trunk,
since the router is a gateway. We need this interface to be trunk since the end devices in the network belong to different VLANs
enter the switch 1 config mode
`int ran g0/1-2`
`sw mode trunk`

4. also add the VLANs missing on the other switches since only S1 has both 
`do show vlan brief` to check vlans on switch

to add vlan:
`enable`
`conf t`
`vlan 100`

5. To configure R1 as a "Router-on-a-stick", with a DHCP server for both VLANs:
enter config mode on R1 after enable 
`interface FastEthernet 0/1`
`no shutdown`

Configure the interface to serve as a gateway for all hosts that use that VLAN
`interface FastEthernet 0/1.100`  -- Create a virtual sub-interface for VLAN 100 on R1
`encapsulation dot1Q 100` -- Describes interface to look for on router for incoming packets, ie. add a VLAN tag of 100

Making sure still in sub interface:
`ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0` === gateway for vlan 100

`................. 192.169. 2 .1 ...... `  == gateway for vlan 200


Setting up DHCP on router.
Since we know how DHCP works not much theory here
DHCP DISCOVER
DHCP OFFER
DHCP REQUEST 
DHCP ACK
We'll have a DHCP server which is the router and the DHCP client as the PCs
Our DHCP server will figure the origin of packets using the VLAN tags and will receive the 0.0.0.0 address from all the PCs using only the VLAN tag to distinguish,
after doing this since we've configured the gateways for the VLANs

We'll configure DHCP pools for our VLANs
Hence:
>in config mode
`ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.0 192.168.1.10`
`ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.2.0 192.168.2.10`

`ip dhcp pool vlan100`
`network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0`
`default-router 192.168.1.1`

Likewise for vlan200 but {192.168.2.0} and default-router (gateway) of 192.168.2.1

Now exit and go to each PC's ip configuration and select DHCP instead of static
It should automatically set the ip address of the client with an ip excluding the excluded-address params

After all is done, to test:
ping from one PC to the ROUTER
ping from one PC to another with the same VLAN
