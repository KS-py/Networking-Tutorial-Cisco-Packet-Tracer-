Router-on-a-stick PART 2
============================
Using the topology, configure :
1. Hostname according to the diagram + Rapid PVST on all switches
2. Access interfaces and VLANs - 8 interfaces per VLAN + PortFast
3. Trunk interfaces
4. Configure Root switches according to all the diagram 
5. VTP: S7 is the server, all others clients 
6. Router on a stick according to the diagram
7. IP addresses on PCs, DHCP server on R1 for all VLANs


Note that the router does not have the additional Fast Ethernet (Fast Ethernet 1/0) interface so we'll add it manually

To get the additional FastEthernet 1/0 on R1, add this module on the router (2811) physical config:
`NM-1FE-TX`:
Open the router
Be in the physical menu
Turn it off
Drag out the port interface 
and drag the NM-1FE-TX into its place


SOLUTIONS:
==========
1.
In the config mode of switch:
`hostname S1`
`spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst`

2.
Access interfaces and VLANs
To shorten all this just type all the configuration commands
for each vlan 
Copy the text for this,
enter config mode on switch and click on paste button
and close CLI 

3.Likewise for trunk interfaces the same approach above can be applied,
remember to also set the FastEthernet 0/24s connecting the router to trunk 


4. 
Navigate to the assigned ROOT BRIDGE
`spanning-tree vlan 700 root primary` on S2

`spanning-tree vlan 800 root primary` on S7

`spanning-tree vlan 900 root primary` on S6


5.
On S7:
`vtp mode server`
`vtp domain Kojo`
`vtp password kojo`

and create the VLANs on it:
`vlan 700`
`name Blue` etc.. for all three

For all other switches which will be clients:
Copy and paste this snippet in each's CLI
`vtp mode client`
`vtp domain Kojo`
`vtp password kojo`


6. 
On router:
`int f0/0`
`no shutdown` for each FastEthernet interface

DO THE ROUTER-ON-A-STICK CONFIG

exclude the first 10 address of each VLAN

7. Configure DHCP on the ROUTER and PCs later
